    <p>The iBallot (Online Voting Application) is a user-friendly and secure platform that enables individuals to cast their votes from the comfort of their homes or offices. The application is divided into two sections: the Admin section and the User section.
<br><br>
The Admin section is accessible only to authorized personnel, who can create, delete, and manage events. The Admin can also announce the results of an event and create a list of candidates who are eligible to participate in the election.
<br><br>
The User section is where registered users can log in and cast their votes. To ensure the security and accuracy of the voting process, users are required to verify their identities by entering an OTP sent to their registered email address. Once a user has been verified, they can vote only once in an event. Attempting to vote more than once will result in the duplicate vote being discarded.
<br><br>
The iBallot application provides a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and cast their votes. The platform also employs robust security measures to protect the integrity of the voting process and prevent unauthorized access.
<br><br>
Overall, iBallot is an excellent solution for organizations and individuals looking for a secure and efficient online voting platform. The application's two-section design ensures that only authorized personnel can manage events, while users can vote with confidence, knowing that their votes will be counted accurately and fairly. </p>
